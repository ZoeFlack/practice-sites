        If you don't know already, David is basically the best guy ever. I
        should know, I'm his wife! He's sweet, funny, and incredibly smart (one
        might even call him a lab coat). Feel free to browse this page to learn
        a little more about him.

      <h2>From Humble Beginnings</h2>
      <p>
        David was born on a snowy day in May 24 years ago. To James Herbert
        Flack and Lynn Ida Flack (nee Lackey). While David was the only human
        baby in his family's home, he found companionship in his parrot brothers
        and sisters.

      <h2>Days in the Schoolyard</h2>
      <p>
        As David grew older his social network expanded. In school, he may not
        have learned to color within the lines, but he did make a ragtag group
        of friends that inspired him to act and dress as his best self.

      <h2>Chaptown Baybee</h2>
      <p>
        Once David was out of diapers and a true latin aficionado, he left the
        Rocky Mountains and headed to the west coast to attend Chapman
        University. He was ready to light up the stage with his cheeky face and
        rollerblade around the town. Little did he know, he was about to meet
        the best woman ever.

      <h2>Twue Luv</h2>
      <p>
        When Zoe met David she thought he was too good to be true. Luckily,
        David reciprocated her feelings and asked her out. Their love quickly
        flourished. David introduced Zoe to
        <a href="https://www.imdb.com/list/ls070150896/" target="_blank"
          >Star Wars</a
        >,
        <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0311113/" target="_blank"
          >Master and Commander</a
        >, and
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moby-Dick" target="_blank"
          >Moby Dick</a
        >. Zoe taught David how to appreciate
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee" target="_blank">coffee</a
        >, and that's about it. But he still liked her for some reason.

      <h2>Route 66</h2>
      <p>
        After graduation, David and Zoe headed from LA to Chicago, making a few
        month pit stop in Colorado. After years of hoping and hint dropping,
        David finallyyyyyyy popped the question and David and Zoe got hitched!
